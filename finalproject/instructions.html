<h1 align="center">GO GAME Instructions</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h4>1. THE GO BOARD (RULE I)</h4>
<p>Go is played on a square board consisting of
any number of crossing lines. The usual board
sizes are 9x9, 13x13 or 19x19 lines, the latter
being the official tournament size.
To explain you the rules of the game we will
use a 7x7 board since that will be more than
sufficient for this purpose.
You start the game with an empty board (but see
section handicap below). The dark spot in the
middle of the board is used both for orientation
and indication (see section handicap below).</p>

<h4>2. LEGAL MOVES (RULE II)</h4>
<p>A Go move is played on the intersections of the
lines. This is different from what you are used
to from other games like chess and checkers. In
the figure we show you the first four moves of
an instruction game. The moves are numbered
to indicate the order in which they were played.
That’s right, in Go the black player moves first!
Another legal move, hard to display in a figure,
is pass. When both players pass the game is
finished.</p>

<h4>3. CAPTURING STONES (RULE III)</h4>
<p>During a Go game one or more stones can be
captured by completely surrounding them, i.e.
filling all empty points around them. We show
two examples: the top figure a one stone capture,
the bottom figure a three stone capture.
After black has played his move at 1 he removes
the captured white stones from the board
leading to the right board positions.
Note: Needless to say that being captured usually
is bad. There are lots of situations though
where one sacrifices one or more stones to gain
advantage elsewhere.</p>

<h4>4. THE AIM OF THE GAME (RULE IV)</h4>
<p>The purpose of Go is to conquer a larger part of
the board than your opponent. The conquered
part exists of the stones placed on the board
plus the stones which could be added safely,
i.e. inside your own walls. The figure shows a
final position. The score for this game would
be: black has 11 stones on the board and could
add 16 stones inside his own walls, white has
11 stones on the board and could add 11 stones
inside his own walls, so the score is 11+16 -
11+11 is 5 points for black. Black won this
game.</p>

<h4>5. AN INSTRUCTION GAME</h4>
<p>We show you an instruction game on the 7x7
board. To avoid having too many numbers
in one figure we have split the moves in two
figures. The first figure shows the first 10
moves, the second figure shows the final 12
moves (11-22). The first four moves you have
seen before in the figure of section Legal moves.
With move 5 black tries to enlarge his claim of
the board meanwhile reducing white’s claimed
area. With 8 white applies this same strategy.
After all borders have been clearly defined the
game is over. As we already have verified in
section The aim of the game black won this
game by five points.</p>

<h4>6. KOMI (RULE V)</h4>
<p>You might argue that it is not fair that black
won the game because he had the advantage of
moving first. You are right about that. That’s
why the white player receives compensation for
the fact that he moves second. This compensation
is called komi (Japanese). Funny enough,
the komi hardly depends on the board size. According
to Japanese professional Go players the
komi should be 5.5 points for the board sizes
9x9, 13x13 and 19x19. In the above game
we played on a 7x7 board. Let’s assume that
the komi would still be 5.5 points, then white
would have won the above game with .5 point,
the smallest margin possible.
Note 1: The amount of komi can differ between
different countries. It can even differ between
different tournaments. Basically it is up to the
organizer to decide with how much komi the
game is played.
Note 2: The fact that the komi includes half a
point (5.5) ensures that the game can’t end in a
draw.</p>


<h4>7. KO (RULE VI)</h4>
<p>Imagine we have the following situation with
black to move:</p>
<img src="7.png"></img>
<p>Black could decide to capture one white stone:</p>
<img src="71.png"></img>
<p>But in the resulting position white is to move
and could in his/her turn decide to capture a
stone:</p>
<img src= "72.png"></img>
<p>The final position is the same as the starting
position. This implies that the move sequence
1-2 could repeat itself endlessly. To avoid this
to happen the game has a special rule, the ko
(Japanese) rule. The ko rule prohibits that the
same position (i.e. the whole board!) repeats
itself.
So in the diagram sequence white 2 is prohibited
because of the ko rule.</p>


<h4>8. HANDICAP (RULE VII)</h4>
<p>One of the (many) nice features of Go is
that you don’t need an opponent of equal
strength/experience to have an exciting game.
The Go game allows you to equalize the players
chances to win by adding some initial stones on
the board:</p>
<img src="8.png"></img>
<p>The larger the strength difference the more
stones you would add. These stones are called
handicap stones. These stones are usually
placed on predestinated points, indicated on the
Go board by a thick spot.
We showed you two examples: a handicap 3
and a handicap 9 game. The latter is usually
considered the maximum for 19x19 Go and (as
you can see from the figure) is far more than
reasonable for 7x7.</p>
